Hi, I am Manavi Nair. I like learning new technologies and working on various projects. I am currently pursuing Master's in Computer Applications. 
I have worked on two personal personal projects:
1) Document Sentiment Analysis
2) Trust based Sentiment Analysis on Social Network
3) Classification Model for classifying the side effects of drugs

I am looking to collaborate on more data analysis projects.
